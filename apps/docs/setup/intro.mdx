# Development Setup Overview

Welcome to the Open SWE development setup guide. This section will walk you through everything you need to know to get Open SWE running locally for development.

## Setup Sections

The setup process is organized into focused sections to help you get up and running efficiently:

## Technology Stack

Open SWE is built with modern technologies designed for scalability and developer experience:

### Core Technologies

- **TypeScript** - Strict type safety across the entire codebase
- **Yarn** - Package manager with workspace support (v3.5.1)
- **Turbo** - Monorepo build orchestration and task running

### Agent Infrastructure

- **LangGraph** - Multi-agent orchestration framework with three specialized graphs:
  - Manager graph for user interaction orchestration
  - Planner graph for execution plan creation
  - Programmer graph for code change execution
- **Local sandbox** - Sandboxed development environments for safe code execution

## Sandbox image prerequisite

Open SWE executes repositories inside a sandbox Docker container. Before starting local tasks, make sure the sandbox image is available on your machine:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/langchain-ai/open-swe/sandbox:latest
```

You can also build the image locally using the dedicated Dockerfile provided in the repository root:

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.sandbox -t ghcr.io/langchain-ai/open-swe/sandbox:latest .
```

The agent uses this image by default via the `LOCAL_SANDBOX_IMAGE` environment variable, so keeping it up to date ensures consistent tooling when the sandbox is created.

### Web Application

- **Next.js** - React framework with App Router
- **Shadcn UI** - Component library built on Radix UI primitives
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework

### Documentation

- **Mintlify** - Documentation platform with MDX support

## Monorepo Structure

<Note>
  Open SWE uses a Yarn workspace monorepo with three main applications and a
  shared package for common utilities and types.
</Note>

- **`apps/open-swe`** - LangGraph agent application
- **`apps/web`** - Next.js web interface
- **`apps/docs`** - Mintlify documentation site
- **`packages/shared`** - Shared utilities, types, and constants

The monorepo is orchestrated by Turbo, which handles build dependencies and parallel task execution across packages.
