description: A collection of example tasks for Open SWE
---

If you want to try out Open SWE, but aren't sure where to start, here are a few example tasks you can try out.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the TypeScript template">
    The examples below are all for TypeScript tasks. For these, you should clone an empty TypeScript template repository:

    Use a TypeScript template repository of your choice and create a new project based on it.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Open the repository in Open SWE">
    Once you have created the repository, open it in the Open SWE UI using the repository selector above the chat input.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit one of the example tasks">
    After cloning the template and giving Open SWE access to it, you can submit one of the example tasks!
  </Step>
</Steps>

Below are a series of examples you can try out:

<Accordion title="RESTful 'Books' micro-service">
  ```txt
  Create an Express-based API exposing CRUD endpoints for `/books`.
  Include request validation with `zod`, proper HTTP status codes, and an
  in-memory repository layer that can later be swapped for a database. Add Jest
  tests covering happy-path and a 'missing ISBN' error case.
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="WebSocket live counter">
  ```txt
  Add a small WebSocket server (using `ws`) that tracks how many clients
  are currently connected and broadcasts the updated count every 5 seconds.
  Expose a health-check HTTP route returning the same value for monitoring
  tools. Provide a minimal HTML demo page that shows the live number.
  ```
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="JWT + refresh-token auth layer">
  ```txt
  Build a middleware that issues short-lived access tokens and long-lived
  refresh tokens. Store refresh tokens in a signed, HttpOnly cookie and expose
  `/auth/refresh` to rotate them. Protect a sample route (`/profile`) and supply
  Postman collections for login and refresh flows.
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Pluggable caching service">
  ```txt
  Design a generic cache interface with `get`, `set`, and `invalidate`
  methods, then provide two adapters: an in-memory `Map` implementation and a
  Redis adapter (mock Redis with `ioredis-mock` for tests). Demonstrate
  hot-swapping the adapter via an environment variable without code changes.
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="GraphQL wrapper over REST API">
  ```txt
  Stand up an Apollo Server that federates data from the public
  JSONPlaceholder `/users` and `/posts` endpoints. Expose a `user(id)` query
  returning the user plus their posts in a single round-trip. Add schema-driven
  TypeScript types (`codegen.yml`) and example queries in `README.md`.
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Image upload to S3 with signed URLs">
  ```txt
  Create an endpoint that returns a time-limited pre-signed PUT URL for
  an S3 bucket (use `@aws-sdk/client-s3`). Include a small React demo (Vite)
  that lets a user pick an image and upload it directly. Validate MIME type on
  the server before signing.
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Locale-aware date utility library">
  ```txt
  Publish an internal `/src/date` module that formats, parses, and
  time-zone-converts dates using `luxon`. Support at least 'en-US', 'de-DE', and
  'ja-JP'. Provide type-safe wrappers, exhaustive unit tests, and a benchmark
  script comparing it to native `Intl.DateTimeFormat`.
  ```
</Accordion>
