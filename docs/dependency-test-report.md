# Dependency and Test Report

## Dependency Markers Detected
- `package.json`

## Dependency Installation
- Ran `yarn install` to ensure workspace dependencies are installed.
  - Warnings about unmet peer dependencies were reported by Yarn.

## Test Execution
- Ran `yarn test` to execute the workspace test suite via Turbo.
  - Tests passed for `@openswe/shared` and `@openswe/agent` packages.
  - No tests were found for `@openswe/agent-v2` and `@openswe/cli` packages (reported by the tooling).
  - Yarn reported several experimental warnings during Jest runs.

## Notes
- No Python, Maven, or Gradle markers were detected, so the corresponding dependency installations and test commands were skipped.
